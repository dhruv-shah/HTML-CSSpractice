<p><h3>Para 1 </h3>
<br>A similar ambiguity occurs in quantum
systems. It is not always possible for a single
measurement in the lab to distinguish how
a photon is polarized, for example. “In real
life, it’s pretty easy to tell west from slightly
south of west, but in quantum systems, it’s
not that simple,” says White. According to the
standard Copenhagen interpretation, there
is no point in asking what the polarization is
because the question does not have an answer
— or at least, not until another measurement
can determine that answer precisely.</p>
<p><h3> Para 2</h3>
But
according to the wavefunction-as-ignorance
models, the question is perfectly meaning­
ful; it is just that the experimenters — like
the card-game player — do not have enough
information from that one measurement to
answer. As with the cards, it is possible to esti­
mate how much ambiguity can be explained
by such ignorance, and compare it with the
larger amount of ambiguity allowed by stand­
ard theory.</p>
<p><h3> Para 3</h3>
<a name = "theorem"></a>That changed in 2011, with the publication
of a theorem about quantum measurements
that seemed to rule out the wavefunction-as-
ignorance models 2 . On closer inspection, how­
ever, the theorem turned out to leave enough
wiggle room for them to survive. Nonetheless,
it inspired physicists to think seriously about
ways to settle the debate by actually testing
the reality of the wavefunction.</p>
